# **A Simple Guide to Contra Dance**

This repository contains the source code for a simple, single-page informational website about the art and craft of Contra Dance. It is designed to be a quick, accessible guide for anyone curious about this social dance form.

## **About The Project**

This web page was generated by Google's Gemini based on the research report "Contra Dance Composition and Calling". It summarizes key aspects of the dance, including:

* What Contra Dance is  
* Its rich history  
* A glossary of core figures (dance moves)  
* The role of music in the dance  
* Modern trends and evolutions

The entire website is contained within a single index.html file for simplicity and ease of deployment.

## **Technologies Used**

* **HTML:** For the basic structure and content.  
* **Tailwind CSS:** For modern, responsive styling, loaded via a CDN.  
* **Vanilla JavaScript:** For a simple search/filter functionality on the dance figures table.  
* **Google Fonts:** For the 'Inter' typeface.
