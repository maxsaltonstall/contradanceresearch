                <h2 class="!mt-0">What is Contra Dance?</h2>
                <p>Contra dance is a vibrant social dance form with deep historical roots. More than just a series of steps, it's a community-building event designed for social interaction. Dancers form lines of couples and progress up and down the hall, dancing with a new couple for each cycle of the dance. It's known for its welcoming atmosphere, live music, and the fact that you don't need to bring a partner to participate.</p>

                <h2>A Rich History</h2>
                <p>Contra dance's lineage traces back to 17th-century English, Scottish, and French country dances. It became popular in the American colonies in the late 18th century. While its popularity waned in cities, it was preserved in rural New England. A major revival in the 1960s and 70s infused the form with new energy, leading to the flowing, energetic style we see today. This history shows a tradition that is always evolving while staying true to its social roots.</p>

            <div class="card">
                <h2>The Heartbeat: Contra Music</h2>
                <p>The music is the soul of contra dance. Most tunes are reels or jigs from Anglo-Celtic traditions. They have a specific structure called <strong>AABB</strong>. A tune consists of two 8-bar parts (A and B), and each is played twice. This creates a 64-beat cycle that perfectly matches one cycle of the dance choreography. This perfect sync between music and movement is fundamental to the contra experience.</p>

                <h2>Choreography in Action: Two Examples</h2>
                <h3>"The Carousel" by Tom Hinds</h3>
                <p>A modern classic known for its incredible flow. The transitions are designed to feel seamless and inevitable, with a brilliant B2 part where a Circle Left Â¾ flows perfectly into a neighbor swing, accomplishing the progression in a smooth, carousel-like motion.</p>
                <h3>"Dela Says Yippee" by Dugan Murphy</h3>
                <p>An energetic Becket formation dance. Its signature is a high-energy A1 part with two quick pull-bys across the set, often accompanied by a joyful "Yippee!". This dance's character comes from the contrast between these sharp, linear moves and two long, rotational partner swings.</p>

                <h2>The Living Tradition: Modern Trends</h2>
                <p>Contra dance continues to evolve, reflecting the values of its community.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Gender-Free Calling:</strong> A major shift is the move from "Gents" and "Ladies" to inclusive terms like "Larks" (person on the left) and "Robins" (person on the right) to create a more welcoming space for all dancers.</li>
                    <li><strong>"Zesty" Dancing:</strong> The modern style emphasizes continuous motion and high energy, with all dancers active for most of the 64 beats.</li>
                    <li><strong>Techno Contra:</strong> An exciting fusion where the traditional band is replaced by a DJ playing electronic dance music, attracting a younger crowd with a high-energy, club-like atmosphere.</li>
